This is the LaTeX source files that compiles my PhD thesis book.

Why I am doing this
------------------

* Because, finally, there is a fairly easy and powerful way to share, contribute and publish your code.
* Because it took me a lot of time to do the formatting and style, and I hope this help the next ones.
* Because, according to the Max Planck rules, one should make available the data of your PhD thesis so that your results are replicable. And I strongly agree with this.
