LaTeX source files for my PhD thesis book. 
==========================================

This is the LaTeX source that compiles my [PhD](brunosan.eu/PhD) with references, images and all.

You are free to use it:
* Thesis content can be used under the Creative Commons Attribution License.
* LaTeX code is released has no copyright claims of any kind.


Why I am doing this
------------------

* Because, finally, there is a fairly easy and powerful way to share, contribute and publish your code.
* Because it took me a lot of time to do the formatting and style, and I hope this help the next ones.
* Because, according to the Max Planck rules, one should make available the data of your PhD thesis so that your results are replicable. And I strongly agree with this.
