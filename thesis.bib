	Abstract = {The application of the cloud model to measurements of the contrast as a function of wavelength in the Halpha line has recently enabled us to derive numerical values for various parameters (such as velocity, source function, Doppler width and optical depth) of dark mottles observed near the center of the solar disk. The values of these parameters are used together with the calculations of Poland et al. (1971SPh....18..391P) and Yakovkin and Zel'dina (1975SPh....45..319Y) in order to determine the physical conditions in these structures. Thus population densities at levels 1, 2, 3 (N_1_, N_2_, N_3_), total particle density of hydrogen N_H_, electron density N_e_, electron temperature T_e_, gas pressure, total column mass, mass density and degree of hydrogen ionization can be determined. The values obtained are comparable with estimates obtained for spicules and mottles by different authors in the past and, furthermore, offer the prospect of putting observational constraints on non-LTE two-dimensional modelling of dark mottles observed in the Halpha line which is currently in progress.},

function, Doppler width and optical depth) of dark mottles observed near
the center of the solar disk. The values of these parameters are used
together with the calculations of Poland et al. (1971SPh....18..391P)
and Yakovkin and Zel'dina (1975SPh....45..319Y) in order to determine
the physical conditions in these structures. Thus population densities
at levels 1, 2, 3 (N_1_, N_2_, N_3_), total particle density of hydrogen
N_H_, electron density N_e_, electron temperature T_e_, gas pressure,
total column mass, mass density and degree of hydrogen ionization can be
determined. The values obtained are comparable with estimates obtained
for spicules and mottles by different authors in the past and,
furthermore, offer the prospect of putting observational constraints on
non-LTE two-dimensional modelling of dark mottles observed in the
Halpha line which is currently in progress.</dc:description></record>},

Unique identification of the mottles throughout their lifetime is much harder than for their active region counterpart, dynamic fibrils. This is because many seem to lack a sharply defined edge at their top, and significant fading often occurs throughout their lifetime. For those mottles that can be reliably tracked, we find that the mottle tops often undergo parabolic paths. We find a linear correlation between the deceleration these mottles undergo and the maximum velocity they reach, similar to what was found earlier for dynamic fibrils. Combined with an analysis of oscillatory properties, we conclude that at least part of the quiet-Sun mottles are driven by magnetoacoustic shocks.

These high cadence observations in two complementary wavelengths have revealed the existence of weak transient disturbances in an extended coronal loop system.

The disturbances originate from small scale brightenings at the footpoints of the loops and propagate along the loops.

The measured slow magnetoacoustic propagation speeds seem to suggest that the transients are sound (or slow) wave disturbances. This work differs from previous studies in the sense that it is based on a multi-wavelength observation of an entire loop bundle at high cadence by two EUV imagers.

They were obtained in April 2002 and May 2003 with the "G{\"o}ttingen" Fabry-P{\'e}rot spectrometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope at the Observatorio del Teide (Tenerife). Speckle methods were applied for image reconstruction which resulted in a spatial resolution of 0.5 arcsec in the magnetograms of the penumbrae. We analysed Stokes I and V profiles of the Fe II 6149 {\AA} line, which exhibits no instrumental Stokes Q/U--> V crosstalk, and of the Fe I line pair at 6302 {\AA}. The main results are the following: 1) on scales larger than 0.5 arcsec, the intensity pattern of penumbrae stays the same in the continuum and core images of the 6301.5 {\AA} line, which stem from 0 km and 300 km (above tau_5=1), respectively. Yet at scales of 0.5 arcsec and smaller the pattern in the two spectral features is clearly different. 2) On the limb side of sunspots the Evershed flow is carried by dark filaments and on the centre side by bright features and their somewhat weakened tails. We explain this with a picture in which the velocity of hot rising gas is best seen on the centre side, while on the limb side the horizontal outward and possibly downward flows are seen when the gas has cooled down. 3) The un-combed structure of the magnetic field is confirmed. On the limb side, the more horizontal fields coincide with dark fibrils or with diffuse intensity structures. Generally, the more horizontal fields are located at the positions of strong outflows. 4) Strong line-of-sight components of the magnetic fields are not found in bright filaments but in dark structures, somewhat displaced from the darkest parts. Their positions do not coincide with those of the strongest velocity fields. In general, our results are compatible with the picture of low lying flow channels coincident with the horizontal magnetic field, or possibly emerging and diving down into sub-photospheric layers, like a "sea serpent".

	Abstract = {One-dimensional hydrostatic models of quiet and active solar regions can be constructed that generally account for the observed intensities of lines and continua throughout the spectrum, except for the infrared CO lines. There is an apparent conflict between a) observations of the strongest infrared CO lines formed in LTE at low-chromospheric heights but at temperatures much cooler than the average chromospheric values, and b) observations of Ca II, UV, and microwave intensities that originate from the same chromospheric heights but at the much higher temperatures characteristic of the average chromosphere. A model M_CO has been constructed which gives a good fit to the full range of mean CO line profiles (averaged over the central area of the solar disk and over time) but this model conflicts with other observations of average quiet regions. A model L_CO which is approximately 100 K cooler than M_CO combined with a very bright network model F in the proportions 0.6L_CO+0.4F is found to be generally consistent with the CO, Ca II, UV, and microwave observations. Ayres, Testerman, and Brault found that models COOLC and FLUXT in the proportions 0.925 and 0.075 account for the CO and Ca II lines, but these combined models give an average UV intensity at 140 nm about 20 times larger than observed. The 0.6L_CO+0.4F result may give a better description of the cool and hot components that produce the space- and time-averaged spectra. Recent observations carried out by Uitenbroek, Noyes, and Rabin with high spatial and temporal resolution indicate that the faintest intensities in the strong CO lines measured at given locations usually become much brighter within 1 to 3 minutes. The cool regions thus seem to be mostly the low- temperature portions of oscillatory waves rather than cool structures that are stationary.},

@article{2007arXiv0710.2934D,
	Abstract = {We use high-resolution observations of the Sun in Ca II H 3968 A from the
Solar Optical Telescope on Hinode to show that there are at least two types of
spicules that dominate the structure of the magnetic solar chromosphere. Both
types are tied to the relentless magnetoconvective driving in the photosphere,
but have very different dynamic properties. ``Type-I'' spicules are driven by
shock waves that form when global oscillations and convective flows leak into
the upper atmosphere along magnetic field lines on 3-7 minute timescales.
``Type-II'' spicules are much more dynamic: they form rapidly (in ~10s), are
very thin (&lt;200km wide), have lifetimes of 10-150s (at any one height) and seem
to be rapidly heated to (at least) transition region temperatures, sending
material through the chromosphere at speeds of order 50-150 km/s. The
properties of Type II spicules suggest a formation process that is a
consequence of magnetic reconnection, typically in the vicinity of magnetic
flux concentrations in plage and network. Both types of spicules are observed
to carry Alfven waves with significant amplitudes of order 20 km/s.},
